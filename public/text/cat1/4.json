{"text": "Spiderman, Spiderman, \n Does whatever a spider can \n Spins a web, any size, \n Catches thieves just like flies \n Look Out! \n Here comes the Spiderman. \n Is he strong? \n Listen bud, \n He's got radioactive blood. \n Can he swing from a thread \n Take a look overhead \n Hey, there \n There goes the Spiderman. \n In the chill of night \n At the scene of a crime \n Like a streak of light \n He arrives just in time. \n Spiderman, Spiderman \n Friendly neighborhood Spiderman \n Wealth and fame \n He's ingnored \n Action is his reward. \n To him, life is a great big bang up \n Whenever there's a hang up \n You'll find the Spider man."}
