{"text": "I been cheated by you since you know when \n So I made up my mind, it must come to an end \n Look at me now, will I ever learn? \n I don't know how but I suddenly lose control \n There's a fire within my soul \n Just one look and I can hear a bell ring \n One more look and I forget everything \n Mamma mia, here I go again \n My my, how can I resist you? \n Mamma mia, does it show again \n My my, just how much I've missed you?"}
