{"text": "Now this is the story all about how \n My life got flipped, turned upside down \n And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there \n I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air \n \n In west Philadelphia born and raised \n On the playground where I spent most of my days \n Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool \n And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school \n When a couple of guys, they were up to no good \n Started making trouble in my neighbourhood \n I got in one little fight and my mom got scared \n And said 'You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air' \n \n I whistled for a cab and when it came near the \n License plate said 'fresh' and had a dice in the mirror \n If anything I could say that this cab was rare \n But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!"}
